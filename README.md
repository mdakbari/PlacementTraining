## 📁 TrainingDay1

The `Training1` folder contains Java code examples for various programming concepts. Below are the details of each file in this folder:

### 📜 Program List

1. **Division.java**
   - 📌 **Description:** This file contains a code example for performing division operations in Java. It demonstrates how to divide two integers and handle the result as a floating-point number.

2. **IfElse.java**
   - 📌 **Description:** This file contains a code example illustrating the use of `if-else` statements in Java. The code reads marks from the user and prints the corresponding grade based on the provided conditions.

3. **Loops.java**
   - 📌 **Description:** This file contains a code example demonstrating the use of `for` and `do-while` loops in Java. The code prints even numbers using a `for` loop and odd numbers using a `do-while` loop, both within the range of 1 to 30.

## 📁 TrainingDay2

The `Training2` folder contains Java code examples for object-oriented programming concepts. Below are the details of each file in this folder:

### 📜 Program List

1. **Animal.java**
   - 📌 **Description:** This file contains a code example for creating a simple `Animal` class in Java. The class has attributes like `name` and `sound`, and methods to set and get these attributes.

2. **Supply.java**
   - 📌 **Description:** This file contains a code example for creating a `Supply` class in Java. The class has attributes like `item` and `quantity`, and methods to set and get these attributes.

3. **Vehicle.java**
   - 📌 **Description:** This file contains a code example for creating a `Vehicle` class in Java. The class has attributes like `make`, `model`, and `year`, and methods to set and get these attributes.
